# Random-Code-Snippets
Random code snippets to involving several problem solving codes.
These are the codes which I have written to explore and solve several interesting problems my way.
It helped me a lot in understanding the basic yet most effective programming principles.Most of the code I have written is based over efficient data fetching from a Public API and manipulating it accordingly.



I consider programming like any other skill and one can master it with sheer practice despite having no previous knowledge (except for basic math and english).Programming is like the art of cooking,sculpture or like learning a musical instrument.All it takes is a goood amount of practice and zeal to know the concepts inside it.
